    "text": "1 - Introduction\nThis project investigates and analyzes the trends and contributions of the global entities in launching outer space objects. By aiming to understand how the number of objects launched have changed over time, we can try to identify the key contributors.\n\n\n2 - Workspace Setup\n\n# Plot Theme\nggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_minimal(base_size = 14))\n\n# Set Width of Code Output\noptions(width = 65)\n\n# Set Figure Parameters for knitr\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(\n  fig.width = 7,        # 7\" width\n  fig.asp = 0.618,      # the golden ratio\n  fig.retina = 3,       # dpi multiplier for displaying HTML output on retina\n  fig.align = \"center\", # center align figures\n  dpi = 300             # higher dpi, sharper image\n)\n\n# Loading Packages\npacman::p_load(\"dplyr\", \"gsubfn\", \"here\", \"knitr\", \"tidyr\", \"stringr\", \"tidyverse\")\npacman::p_load(\"rworldmap\", \"rworldxtra\", \"maps\", \"ggplot2\", \"patchwork\", \"gtable\", \"gt\")\n\n# Loading Necessary Dataset\nspace_data &lt;- read.csv(here(\"data/outer_space_objects.csv\"))\ngdp_data &lt;- read.csv(here(\"data/gdp_data_top_5.csv\"))\n\n\n\n3 - Dataset\n\nglimpse(space_data)\n\nRows: 1,175\nColumns: 4\n$ Entity      &lt;chr&gt; \"APSCO\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"â€¦\n$ Code        &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"DZA\", \"DZA\", \"DZA\", \"DZA\", \"AGO\", \"AGOâ€¦\n$ Year        &lt;int&gt; 2023, 2002, 2010, 2016, 2017, 2017, 2022, 1â€¦\n$ num_objects &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1â€¦\n\nglimpse(gdp_data)\n\nRows: 5\nColumns: 10\n$ Country.Name   &lt;chr&gt; \"China\", \"Germany\", \"India\", \"Japan\", \"Uâ€¦\n$ Country.Code   &lt;chr&gt; \"CHN\", \"DEU\", \"IND\", \"JPN\", \"USA\"\n$ Indicator.Name &lt;chr&gt; \"GDP (current US$)\", \"GDP (current US$)\"â€¦\n$ Indicator.Code &lt;chr&gt; \"NY.GDP.MKTP.CD\", \"NY.GDP.MKTP.CD\", \"NY.â€¦\n$ X2018          &lt;chr&gt; \"13,900,000,000,000\", \"3,970,000,000,000â€¦\n$ X2019          &lt;chr&gt; \"14,300,000,000,000\", \"3,890,000,000,000â€¦\n$ X2020          &lt;chr&gt; \"14,700,000,000,000\", \"3,890,000,000,000â€¦\n$ X2021          &lt;chr&gt; \"17,800,000,000,000\", \"4,280,000,000,000â€¦\n$ X2022          &lt;chr&gt; \"18,000,000,000,000\", \"4,080,000,000,000â€¦\n$ X2023          &lt;chr&gt; \"17,900,000,000,000\", \"4,400,000,000,000â€¦\n\n\nI have chosen this Outer Space Objects dataset. This dataset contains detailed information about the various entities launching outer space objects over the course of time. Each entry or record contains the entityâ€™s name, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code for some specific entities, the year when this observation was captured, and the number of objects launched.\nI am particularly interested in the growing field of space exploration and monitoring, understanding the trends in object launch events, and identifying these major contributors can provide valuable insights in the progress and focus areas. This analysis could potentially highlight the advancements in space technologies and the collaborative efforts of different entities worldwide.\nThis dataset also allows me to explore the dynamics of contributions from various countries. By analyzing these contributions over time, we can gain a deeper understanding of the shifts in focus and resource allocation in the domain of deep space monitoring. Such insights could inform strategics for future investments and collaborations in space exploration, monitoring, and soon enough, militarization.\n\nspace_data_summary &lt;- paste(\n  nrow(space_data), min(space_data$Year), max(space_data$Year)\n)\n\nprint(space_data_summary)\n\n[1] \"1175 1957 2023\"\n\ngdp_data_summary &lt;- paste(\n  nrow(gdp_data)\n)\n\nprint(gdp_data_summary)\n\n[1] \"5\"\n\n\nThe dataset outer_space_objects.csv contains 1175 entries with information on outer space objects recorded by different entities. The columns in it are : â€˜Entityâ€™, â€˜Codeâ€™, â€˜Yearâ€™, and â€˜num_objectsâ€™. The dataset spans from 1957, to the most recent 2023. Since this dataset is not only very comprehensive, but also primarily quantitative, it allows for a detailed analysis of trends and contributions over time.\nThe dataset gdp_data_top_5.csv contains 5 entries with information on GDPs of the BIG 5. The columns in it are : â€˜Country.Nameâ€™, â€˜Country.Codeâ€™, â€˜Indicator.Nameâ€™, â€˜Indicator.Codeâ€™, â€˜X2018â€™, â€˜X2019â€™, â€˜X2020â€™, â€˜X2021â€™, â€˜X2022â€™, and â€˜X2023â€™.\n\n\n4 - Questions\nAfter taking into consideration, feedback from my peers, questions have been altered.\n\nWhat are the trends in the number of outer space objects launched over the years ?\nWhich entities have contributed the most to the number of outer space objects launched ? Considering the TOP 5 Economies in the world have changed over the years, how have their space launch programs reacted to the changes in their respective economies ?\n\nQ3 is NOT a necessary question, but Iâ€™m just curious, so Iâ€™m going to attempt it.\n\nIf we have to predict the future, how will the the outer space object launch trend line look like ?\n\n\n\n5 - Analysis Plan\nBased on my analysis, analysis plan has been altered.\n\nTrends Over the Years :\n\nVariables Involved - Year, total_objects.\nPlan :\n\nAggregate the space data by year.\nCreate a smooth line plot to show the trend of total objects launched over the years.\nCreate a line plot to show the accurate trend of total objects launched over the years, highlighting any discrepancies in trends.\nHighlight recent years for focus.\n\n\nBIG 5 :\n\nOverall Space Launch Trends :\n\nVariables Involved - Year, total_objects, Entity.\nPlan -\n\nAggregate the space data for the TOP 5 economies based on their GDP.\nCreate a smooth line plot to visualize the number of objects launched by the BIG 5 since the 1950s.\nUse GDP data to provide context and insights into the space launch capabilities.\n\n\nGeo - Distribution of Recent Launch Trends :\n\nVariables Involved - world_map, Latitude, Longitude, total_objects, Entity\nPlan -\n\nUse a world map to plot the geographic distribution of recent space launches.\nOverlay the launch data onto the geographic centers (centroids) of the BIG 5 respectively.\nUse size points to represent the total number of objects launched.\n\n\n\nOuter Space Launch Prediction :\n\nVariables Involved - yearly_data, forecast_model\nPlan -\n\nImplement a forecast model to predict future launches.\nAllow user to choose the prediction model from ARIMA, ETS, and TBATS, as well as the number of years to forecast (LIMIT 27).\nDisplay the forecast results with confidence intervals on a line plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n6 - Modus Operandi\nI have something in mind for this, I just hope itâ€™s possible.ðŸ˜£\nI had something in mind for this, I just hoped itâ€™s possible.
